##FinalVersionCode
This directory contains all the codes we applied for the project. Please read in the following order:
* 1_orginalPG using to separate the data into three subsets.
* 2.1_Segment1/2.2_Segment2/2.3_Segment3 using to separate each of these three subsets into four workflow segments (one more segment for outliers).
* 2.1.1segment1/2.1.2segment1/2.1.3segment1/2.1.4segment1 using to add TIME_USED column into each of four workflow segments of subset1
* 2.2.1segment2/2.2.2segment2/2.2.3segment2/2.2.4segment2 using to add TIME_USED column into each of four workflow segments of subset2
* 2.3.1segment3/2.3.2segment3/2.3.3segment3/2.3.4segment3 using to add TIME_USED column into each of four workflow segments of subset3
* 2.1.1_table/2.1.2_table/2.1.3_table/2.1.4_table using to create EDA table for each of four workflow segments of subset1 
* 2.2.1_table/2.2.2_table/2.2.3_table/2.2.4_table using to create EDA table for each of four workflow segments of subset2
* 2.3.1_table/2.3.2_table/2.3.3_table/2.3.4_table using to create EDA table for each of four workflow segments of subset3
* 2.1.1DT/2.1.2DT/2.1.3DT/2.1.4DT using to create model for each of four workflow segments of subset1 
* 2.2.1DT/2.2.2DT/2.2.3DT/2.2.4DT using to create model for each of four workflow segments of subset2
* 2.3.1DT/2.3.2DT/2.3.3DT/2.3.4DT using to create model for each of four workflow segments of subset2
